<h2>Basic Game</h2>
<p>The basic game of Crazy Eights uses two standard 52 card packs shuffled together.  The dealer deals (singly) five cards to each player.  The undealt stock is placed face down on the table, and the top card of the stock is turned face up and placed beside the stock to start the discard pile.

Starting with the player to the dealer's left, and continuing clockwise, each player in turn must either play a legal card face up on top of the discard pile, or draw a card from the undealt stock. 
<br/><br/>
The follow plays are legal:<br/>
<div style="margin-left:1cm;">If the top card of discard pile is not an eight you may play any card which matches the rank or suit of the previous card. For example if the top card is a king of hearts you can play either a king or a heart.
</div><br/>
<div style="margin-left:1cm;">An eight may be played on any card, and the player of the eight must numinate a suit, which must be played next.</div><br/>
<div style="margin-left:1cm;">If an eight is on top of the pile, you may play any card of the suit nominated by the person who played the eight.
</div>
</p>
<h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
<p>The first player who gets rid of all their cards wins, and the other players score penalty points according to the cards they have left in their hands: 50 points for an eight, 10 for a face card, and all other cards at face value (one point for an ace, two for a two and so on).
</p>
<h2>Drawing Cards</h2>
<p>In the normal game, you may always use your turn to draw a card.  The drawn card can be played immediately if it is a legal playe.  You must continue drawing until you can play.
</p>
<h2>Cards requiring special actions</h2>
