TODO:
Slow down opponent animation and turns.
Slow down card animation when cursoring over.
Add delay when cursoring over to avoid the dreaded each card is drawn as you go across them (delay, and slow down animation)
Convert to canvas / silverlight application.
Change AI to play highest card.
Add a log with actions that occured.
Implement an undo scheme.
Show cards organized.

BUGS:
[x] Eights not handled correctly with opponents.
[x] Reshuffle should happen as soon as card level is 0, not when user clicks deal and card level is 0.

[x] Twos not handled correctly.  Allow user a choice to play a two if they have one, or penalize them by drawing two cards.

[x] when winning a hand with a duece, player should not draw two cards - those go against his/her score
[x] when an opponent evalutes for a move, they should not choose an eight if other plays are available
[x] Allows user to play an eight when he/she has other suit cards
[x] Draw two logic should not apply when deck is empty
[ ] When opponent calculates proper suit for wildcard it should not count eights in the suit count

[ ] Detect and Fix stalemate (by reshuffling?)
[ ] Fix Scoring
[ ] Add Draw Card animation
